### Discrepancy Between Conviction Prices At Creation

We acknowledge the observed discrepancy in the Conviction prices between the _for_ and _against_ vaults upon their creation.&#x20;

Please be assured that we are actively working on a resolution. It's important to understand that the functionality of the vaults remains unaffected by this discrepancy.&#x20;

The Conviction price of one vault is not directly impacted by the other, as Conviction and its price are determined by the assets within each specific vault.&#x20;

On creation, Claims are meant to be created with the same amount of tokens in the _for_ and _against_ vaults. We are working on a solution to ensure that this is the case, as they should be neutral on creation.
