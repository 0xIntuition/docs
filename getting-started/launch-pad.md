# üöÄ Launch Pad

Welcome to Intuition, Builder!&#x20;

You can access our Portal app by checking out [portal.intuition.systems](https://portal.intuition.systems). You can experiment with the flows we've built around interacting with our key primitives such as [Identities](../primitives-and-interactions/primitives/identities.md) and [Claims](../primitives-and-interactions/primitives/claims.md). You can connect your wallet to our Portal, sign the message, and begin exploring!

### Exploring the Intuition Portal

Our Portal app is our opinionated approach to building user interactions on top of our protocol and API.    We encourage you to explore, experiment, and collaborate in adding to the Intuition Knowledge Graph! You can contribute by adding Identities, creating Claims, providing Attestations, and Querying data.&#x20;

The Portal user journeys are a combination of onchain interactions and offchain requests to our API. We're excited for developers to build on of our public API and protocol, and we're continuing to create more resources to empower builders.&#x20;

If you're a developer who is eager to start building you can dive right in from our [Dev Quick Start](dev-quick-start.md) or you can continue to explore other doc sections for specific information.
