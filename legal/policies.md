### Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Intuition Portal (the “Site” or “Service”), a service provided by Intuition Systems Inc ("Intuition," "We," "Our," or "Us"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle and protect the information you provide when using our platform.

Your privacy is important to us, and this Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect it. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Site, or any of our Services

**1. Information collection and use**

We collect information when you register or enter information on our site. We may use the information we collect from you to personalize your experience and improve our website in order to better serve you.

**2. Cookies**

We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies in case they are used to provide a service that you use.

You can prevent cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, but be aware that disabling cookies will result in disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.

**Types of cookies we may use**

* Login related cookies: We use cookies to manage user authentication and use sessions. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit our page.
* Essential cookies: Essential cookies are essential for our website to function. They allow visitors to move around our website and use its basic features, such as triggering notifications upon completing a transaction.
* Personalization cookies: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make (such as user preferences, themes, and timezones) to provide enhanced, more personal features

**3. Security**

We value your trust and are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\


**4. Links to other websites**

\
Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**5. Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly market to nor collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can investigate.

**6. Onchain and Offchain data**

Using Intuition Portal to create claims and share content (“Claims” or “Attestations”) results in the creation of both offchain and onchain data. Through use of our Service, users acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with making public attestations.

Onchain data is immutable and offchain data may be stored using decentralized services like IPFS. We can hide content from the Intuition Portal UI that violates our Terms of Use, but onchain data is immutable and remains on the blockchain while offchain data may potentially persist on third party storage.

Intuition Portal is a neutral platform that enables Attestations. We don't control nor endorse and are not liable for attestation content created by users or third parties. Users are accountable for their attestations and must ensure legal and best practice compliance. By using our Service, users indemnify Intuition against any claims, damages, or legal actions arising from their attestations or misuse of Intuition Portal.

**7. Third-party responsibility**

Intuition is not responsible for the data handling practices or policies of third-party providers like IPFS or other third parties that issue or store attestations. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies and relevant terms of service of these third parties to understand how they manage data or interact with the Intuition Protocol.

**8. Updates to this policy**

We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. Users are encouraged to review it regularly to stay informed about our data practices.

**9. Contact us**
