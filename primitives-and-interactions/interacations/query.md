# Querying

## Querying

In Intuition, querying is more than just a featureâ€”it's central to our ethos. We've designed our system to allow you to swiftly and flexibly query identities, claims, and attestations, catering to your specific needs with precision.

***

**Query Identities:** Delve into the data by querying identities to extract the insights you require. Here's how you can navigate:

* **By Unique Identifiers**: Search using specific identity IDs.
* **By Creators**: Find all identities created by specific ETH addresses.
* **By Display Names**: Search based on human-readable names associated with identities.
* **By Descriptions**: Filter identities based on their descriptive text.

***

**Query Claims:** Enhance your understanding by querying claims from various perspectives:

* **By Claim IDs**: Directly fetch claims using their unique identifiers.
* **By Creators**: Identify claims initiated by specific ETH addresses.
* **By Subjects**: Filter claims based on specific subject IDs.
* **By Predicates**: Discover claims based on specific predicate IDs.
* **By Objects**: Retrieve claims that reference specific object IDs.
* **By Attestation Count**: Filter claims based on the number of attestations they have, either in favor of or against.
