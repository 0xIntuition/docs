# Claims

### What Are Claims?

**Claims** are in the format of [semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\_triple), a standardized format that allows users to create arbitrarily complex statements using primitive building blocks.&#x20;

### Claim Structure

Each Claim is composed of three parts: {Subject, Predicate, Object}, each of which, in the Intuition system, must be an **Identity**.
